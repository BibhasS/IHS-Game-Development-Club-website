## Welcome

Welcome to the official Game Development Club of Independence High Schoolâ€”the best start for those aspiring to become great developers.

## About Us

Our club is dedicated to teaching game development efficiently and collaboratively. Utilizing the Godot engine and the C# programming language, which closely resembles Java in syntax, we aim to build practical skills and teamwork.

### How We Operate

- **Weekly Meetings:** Held during advisory periods, these sessions include presentations on game engine concepts followed by practical exercises similar to labs in computer science classes.
- **Homework Labs:** Members are expected to complete weekly labs at home, each designed to take about an hour and reinforce the concepts discussed during meetings.
- **Second Semester Projects:** In the second semester, the club shifts to a team project structure, simulating a real development studio environment. Members plan and manage tasks during meetings and work on them at home.

### Joining the Club

- **Open Membership:** All students are welcome to join at any point during the school year.
- **Continuous Support:** Assistance and guidance are available through our club server.
- **Project Participation:** Members wishing to participate in team projects must complete the labs.
